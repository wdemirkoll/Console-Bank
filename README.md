# 🏦 Console Bank (C++)

**Console Bank** is a simple yet educational **console-based banking simulation** written in C++.  
This project is designed for those who want to learn the basics of C++ input/output, loops, conditions, and menu-driven systems.  

Users can view their cash, check their card balance, deposit or withdraw money.  
All operations are performed entirely through the console.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to help beginners understand how to use
